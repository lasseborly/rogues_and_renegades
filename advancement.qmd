## Experience Points (XP)

Treasure gained, counts as experience points at a rate of 1 GP = 1 XP. Experience is only awarded for treasure acquired, returned to a place of safety and spent on training, sparring, practice or research.

Training, sparring, practice, research etc. can be done at a rate of 400 XP = 1 Day.

For example, if Barthal the Cleric and Darion the Figther returns to town with 800 GP they can decide to divide the gold equally. Darion decides to buy himself a War Horse (200 GP) and spent the remaining 200 GP on sparring sessions for half a day (200 XP). Barthal decides to get himself a new Maze (6 GP), store 194 GP in his temple and spent the remaining 200 GP on attending sermons for half a day (200 XP).
